Make sure yarn is installed properly for this project to run (debian tutorial: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-yarn-on-debian-9/)
This application runs an express server from the backend folder which then reads the frontend build folder data.

A separate mongoDB server should be running on the same box as this application. You may need to initialize a database called "resumeDB"

#   BACKEND INSTRUCTIONS
#
###
    MAKE SURE YOUR USER ACCOUNT HAS THE ABILITY TO BIND TO PORT 80! (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7929563/node-js-express-app-wont-start-listening-on-port-80)
    running 'yarn start' in the backend folder starts the express server through a pm2 daemon.

###
#
#   FRONTEND INSTRUCTIONS
#
###
    Frontend should work out of the box, the build files are there from previous builds.
    Any changes to frontend code need to be rebuilt either with the build.sh file or by running 'yarn build' from the frontend directory

    If you want to add badges but do not want to add them as "profiles" to your resume json you can add them in the userInput.js file (/frontend/src/userInput.js)

    This will scrape the most current 100 insect/spider records and insert them into your running mongoDB.
