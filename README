Make sure yarn is installed properly for this project to run (debian tutorial: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-yarn-on-debian-9/)
This application runs an express server from the backend folder that reads the frontend build folder data.

A separate mongoDB server should be running on the same box as this application. You may need to initialize a database called "resumeDB"

###
#
#   BACKEND INSTRUCTIONS
#
###
    running 'yarn start' in the backend folder starts the express server through a pm2 daemon.

###
#
#   FRONTEND INSTRUCTIONS
#
###
    Frontend should work out of the box, the build files are there from previous builds.
    Any changes to frontend code need to be rebuilt either with the build.sh file or by running 'yarn build' from the frontend directory
